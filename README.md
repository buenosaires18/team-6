# PROJECT is an automated tool that integrates Airtable used as data base, Paper Form used to recolate data from the company, Chatfuel used as chatbot, Zapier used as integrator of applications, and Facebook as our main platform to connect with students. The users are able to receive information from the company depending on the interests inputed by them in a form given beforehand using the Facebook Messenger platform. This tool gives the advantage of giving and receiving information from the users (such as job offers and data from users) by using a common application as the Facebook Messenger is for many in the present time.
